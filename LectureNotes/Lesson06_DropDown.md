## How do we handle dropdowns using Selenium?

### HOW MANY TYPES OF DROPDOWN ARE THERE?

## 1) Select dropdowns: are created by using <select> tag in HTML

	<select>
		<option value="1"> option1 </option>
		<option value="2"> option2 </option>
		<option value="3"> option3 </option>
	</select>
- use select class to locate them.
- by value,index and text

## 2) HTML dropdowns: these are the dropdowns that are created NOT USING <select>
- These dropdowns are handled just like any other webElement you will see on the page.
