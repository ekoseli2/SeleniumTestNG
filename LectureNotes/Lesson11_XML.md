# Creating Object Repository in Selenium WebDriver: XML & Properties file

### What is XML file in Selenium?

Selenium WebDriver Object Repository Using XML File. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. An XML File uses Document Object Model(DOM) 
as the basic structure. XML File format will replicate the HTML format upon which the webpage is constructed

The major advantage of using object repository is the segregation of objects from test cases. If the locator value of one web element changes, only 
the object repository needs to be changed rather than making changes in all test cases in which the locator has been used. Maintaining an object repository 
increases the modularity of framework implementation.

Types of Object Repositories in Selenium Web Driver
Selenium WebDriver does not offer an in-built object repository by default. However, object repositories can be built using the key-value pair 
approach wherein the key refers to the name given to the object and value refers to the properties used to uniquely identify an object within the web page.

## The following are the types of object repositories that can be created in Selenium WebDriver.

### 1) Object Repository using Properties file
### 2) Object Repository using XML file
